c
c   This module collects water flux information from other modules
c   linked in the xtop_prms model. Residual water contents and
c   reservoir volumes and mixing ratios are then calculated for
c   input into the phreeq_mms module.
c
c   webmod_res is therefore an interface module that can be used
c   as a template for preparing fluxes computed in other modules,
c   xprms for example, for input into phreeq_mms. All depths are
c   to be in meters. If they are not they must be converted for
c   volumes to be calculated correctly.
c
c   Fluxes begin with the canopy interception,
c   proceed through snowpack and hillslope reservoirs, and then
c   finish with inputs into the stream routing.
c
c   24Apr09 - Added FORTRAN 90 Module WEBMODRES
c
c   17Sep03 - Created with RCS version control
c 
c     
c  This module can be adapted to work with other models by performing the
c  necessary water tracking calculations to provide a list of reservoirs
c  with water fluxes into and out of each similar reservoir.
c
c  The inputs to phreeq_mms are series of volumes, in cubic meters,
c  of inputs for a forward-feeding constantly mixed reactor series.
c
c  For example,
c  inputs for the root zone would be
c  root_zone_1* = root_zone_0 + precip + snowmelt
c                 + recharge from the saturated zone
c
c  ET (pure water) removed from root_zone_1* results in root_zone_1 that
c  provides output chemistry for recharge, QUZ.
c
c  QUZ_1 = QUZ_0 + root_zone_1
c
c  and so on for the cascading reservoirs
c  
c The main structural element is a volume mixing matrix, for example,
c vmix_can to describe volumes entering and leaving the canopy.
c All mixing matrices are dimensioned (nmru,nresinp) except for the
c unsaturated zone, vmix_uz(nac,nmru,nresinp), the reservoirs
c that distribute hillslope exports to strema segments, 
c vmix_hillexp(nhydro,nmru), and the stream segments, vmix_stream(nhydro).
c
c A hillslope reservoir, vmix_hill, is provided for mixing all unique
c hillslope inputs before routing to the drainage system, vmix_stream.
c
c The beginning and ending volumes for the hillslope reservoir, and all
c other transient reservoirs, will always be zero for any time step.
c
c The final index of any hillslope mixing matrix contains nresinp values.
c The index nresinp begins with four volumes for the current reservoir
c type:

c     1) the initial volumes
c     2) the sum of input volumes,
c     3) the sum of descharge volumes,
c     4) and the reservoir volume at the end of the time step.
c These are followed by volumes from all potential inputs (zero if no 
c input from that source in that timestep). For WEBMOD_RES inputs and
c matrix placements include the following:
c     5) precipitation (rain or snow)
c     6) ET (considered a negative input for mixing)
c     7) impervious surface (not implemented yet)
c     8) canopy or vegetation
c     9) snow melt
c    10) O-horizon (flushed with overland flow, reservoir leaf-on water)
c    11) unsaturated zone (root zone, recharge, residual water)
c    12) shallow unsaturated zone (fixed volume flushed with direct flow)
c    13) saturated zone (base flow)
c    14) exfiltrated water (springs or wetlands)
c    15) deep preferential flow (tile drains or other)

c           made available to simulate sources from a leaky drainage
c           canal and influx from ground water sources upgradient of

c
c vmix_stream, the drainage segments. The combined hillslope inputs are

c
c In addition to the transient hillslope reservoir, five more
c transient reservoirs will be used:
c
c vmix_uz2can(nac,nmru) will be used to mix unsaturated-zone water
c      from individual wetness index bins to provide water chemistry
c      for the flux transpired up to the canopy.
c
c vmix_sat2uz(nmru) will be used to track how much total water to
c      transfer from the saturated zone to the unsaturated zone as
c      a result of wetting the root zone and from stranded pore water
c      resulting from the water table lowering.
c
c vmix_uz2sat(nac,nmru) will be used to mix uz waters for recharge.
c      This water is apportioned to preferential flow and recharge
c      of the saturated zone.
c
c vmix_well(nmru) will be used to track water pumped from the
c       saturated zone. It will be equal to to irrig_sat_mru.
c
c vmix_diversion(nhydro) will be used to track water pumped or
c      diverted from stream segments.
c
c 27apr04 - Modified to include flux of potential infiltration
c      of precip, melt, and throughfall directly to saturated zone.
c
c 14jun04 - Added irrigation from internal and external sources
c
c 29sep04 - Added ground water loss from MRU and channel segments
c
c 22nov04 - Added basin summary variables (_cm) to be passed to
c      the summary module web_sum.f
c
c   may09 - Add Fortran90 Module: WEBMOD_ROUTE

c   of water from the uz to the saturated zone.
