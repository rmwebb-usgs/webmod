 chvar            1  indicates units of permil. 
 A c_metric of 6 (net) is not valid. 
 A c_metric of 4 (rxn) will report the delta of 18O or D 
 in the evapotranspiration from that reservoir. 
 If the selected solute is not an isotope 
 the value will remain at zero. All subsequent 
 warnings about isotopes for other chvars will be ignored.
