                Water, Energy, and Biogeochemical Model (WEBMOD)

This file describes three batch versions of WEBMOD for Windows and Linux: (1) A
Windows version with a compiled executable, (2) A Windows version that has source
code that can be compiled with Visual Studio solutions that are generated by CMake,
and (3) A Linux version with source code that can be compiled by a Makefile generated
by configure. For Linux, there is no version with an executable, and compilation is
required.

No graphical user interface exists for Linux. (For Windows, the graphical user
interface is the MMS Tool which has a feature called the Parameter Tool as described in

Markstrom, S.L., and Koczot, K.M., 2008, User’s manual for the object user 
  interface (OUI)—An environmental resource modeling framework: U.S. Geological 
  Survey Open File Report 2008–1120, 39 p. 
  [Also available at http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2008/1120/.]

Input files are all ASCII file that can be edited with a text editor
such as Notepad or Notepad++.
The Notepad++ interface has the additional advantage of syntax highlighting
for PHREEQC input files such as webmod.pqi.
Notepad++ is available at http://www.hydrochemistry.eu/downl.html.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------   
C. Installing the Windows batch version of WEBMOD with executable
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: the person installing the software generally must have administrator 
rights. 

To install the batch version, double-click webmod-@VERSION@-@REVISION@.msi to
execute the installation program and follow the directions on the screen. The batch
version is completely independent from the GUI version.

Default installation is in the directory:
C:\Program Files\USGS\webmod-@VERSION@-@REVISION@-x64

which includes subdirectories:
   bin\
   doc\
   lib\
   projects\
   src\
   test\

The installation sets environmental variables PATH, PATH_WEBMOD, and WEBMOD_ROOT.
    
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------   
D. Compiling and installing the Windows batch version of WEBMOD without executable
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In general, to compile the IPhreeqc library, you will need:

   (a) CMake (build process manager)
   (b) a C++ compiler,
   (c) familiarity with the compiler and the Windows operating system.
  
   
D.1. Download and install CMake

   CMake can be downloaded from http://www.cmake.org/. If you download the
   executable, CMake is installed when you execute it.
	
D.2. Unzip the distribution file webmod-@VERSION@-@REVISION@.zip
  
   The directory webmod-@VERSION@-@REVISION@ is created when the files are
   extracted; if this directory already exists, you may want to delete or rename it
   before extracting the files.

   The following directory structure is created (the contents of each directory are
   shown to the right):

   webmod-@VERSION@-@REVISION@      Files related to CMake
     `--lib         Java classes for MMS Tool and Parameter Tool GUIs
     `--doc         Documentation files 
     `--projects    Examples from user's guide--limited version of Andrews used in verification test
     `--src         Source code
     `--test        Files used to test the compilation 
 
D.3.  Generate a Visual Studio solution
 
   CMake has many options other than Visual Studio, but here we assume that you are
   using some version of Visual Studio. On the first use of CMake, it may be
   necessary to close all Visual Studio instances.
 	
   Open CMake. 
   
      Fill in the top two lines:
         Where is the source code: 
            The top level directory (ie c:/webmod-@VERSION@-@REVISION@).
         Where to build the binaries: 
            A new directory. It is suggested that the name of the directory include
	    the characteristics of the library that is built, including the VS
	    version, and 32/64 bit, such as VS2012_x64.
 	
   Click Configure. 
      From the pulldown menu of the cmake-gui popup, select the 64-bit version 
      for your Visual Studio. Normally, the default radio button should be 
      sufficient. Click Finish.
 	
   Options in the top panel:
      (1) CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX--Sets the the install directory where the 
             library and header files will be saved. It is suggested that
 	     an INSTALL directory be defined inside the directory chosen 
 	     for the binaries.
 	
   Click Configure until the screen is not red. If the screen remains red, you will
   have to deal with the CMake error messages.
 	
   Click Generate.
 	
   You should now have a Visual Studio solution file (.sln) in the directory chosen
   for the binaries (second line of CMake screen). At any point, you can delete the
   contents of the directory and start over. You can make solutions for different
   Visual Studios, or different options in other directories.
 	
D.4. Compile and install WEBMOD
 
   Open the Visual Studio solution in the build directory defined in CMake.
 	
   The default configuration is "Debug". If you want a release libraries
   (or dlls) and examples, change the configuration to "Release".
 
   Build ALL_BUILD. 
      IPhreeqc is compiled.
      mmf is compiled.
      webmod is compiled.
      all modules and libraries are linked and webmod executable created.
 
   Build RUN_TESTS. Programs that test webmod are compiled and run, and optionally
   (CMake IWEBMOD_FORTRAN_TESTING option) the Fortran test project.
 	
   Build INSTALL. 
      The executables, WEBMOD database files, and documentation are installed in the
      install directory selected in CMake (denoted "install" in the following
      descriptions).
      
   Install:
      RELEASE.txt                           Release notes
      README.txt                            this readme file
      NOTICE.txt                            User rights notice
 
   Install\bin directory:
      Subdirectories with executables

   Install\lib files:
 				
   Install\doc files:
      Manual for WEBMOD version 1
      webmod.txt                       Short explanation for WEBMOD
      webmod3.chm                      Latest WEBMOD documentation
    
  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------   
E. Compiling and installing the Linux batch version of WEBMOD 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No support beyond this README file is provided for users compiling their own
versions of the software. In general, to compile the software, you will need:

       (a) a C++ compiler, and
       (b) a Fortran compiler, and
       (c) a minimal level of knowledge of configure, Make, the compiler, and
           the Linux operating system.

A Makefile can be generated by configure, and the Makefile can be used to
compile, test, and install the software.

E.1. Extracting the files

   Follow the steps below to extract the files from a distribution tar file.

   Steps in extracting files                  Explanation
   ----------------------------------------   -----------------------------------
   gunzip webmod-@VERSION@-@REVISION@.source.tar.gz           Uncompress the tar.gz file.
 
   tar -xvpof webmod-@VERSION@-@REVISION@.source.tar          Extract files from the tar file.

   The directory webmod-@VERSION@-@REVISION@ is created when the files are
   extracted; if this directory already exists, you may want to delete or rename it
   before extracting the files.

   The following directory structure is created (the contents of each directory are
   shown to the right):

   webmod-@VERSION@-@REVISION@      Files related to configure
     `--config      More configure files
     `--doc         Documentation files 
     `--projects    Examples from user's guide--A minimal run of Andrews is used in verification tests
     `--src         Source code
     `--test        Files used to test the compilation

Notes:  (a) A compiled executable is not included in the source distribution.
            
        (b) It is recommended that no user files be kept in the WEBMOD directory
	    structure.

E.2.  Change directory to the directory that was extracted from the tar file.

      cd webmod-@VERSION@-@REVISION@
        
E.3.  Make a directory, for example, Release.
    
      mkdir Release
    
E.4.  Change directory to Release.
    
      cd Release

E.5.  Run configure
    
   Many of the options for configure can be seen by typing:
    
      ../configure --help
        
   The most common option: --prefix=dir specifies the directory for installation of
      the library. Default is /usr/local, $HOME would install to your home directory.
            
   Run configure as follows:    
    
      ../configure [options] 

E.6.  Compile the program
    
    make [-j n]

    Optionally, use -j n--where n is the number of compilations make runs in parallel.
    
E.7.  Check that compiled version runs the test cases. 
   Check may take several minutes.
    
      make check
    
   Results of running the test cases are stored in the directory Release/test

E.8. Install the program. 

   By default the program is installed in /usr/local/bin and
   /usr/local/share/doc/webmod. You can specify an installation prefix other than
   "/usr/local" by using the prefix option, prefix=$HOME for example.
    
      make install
        
   The locations of various files are given below, where "install" is the
   installation directory, /usr/local by default, or the value given by the --prefix
   option to configure.
    
   Executable:
      install/bin/webmod

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
F. Running WEBMOD
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The WEBMOD executable is installed in the .\bin\ directory. if .\bin\ is in the PATH, then
WEBMOD can be executed from a selected .\projects directory such as .\projects\Andrews\
with the command

webmod -C.\control\webmod.control

to execute the simulation specified in the projects\Andrews\control\webmod.control

Alternatively, WEBMOD can be run by a script on Linux or a batch file on Windows.
The scripts and batch files are run in the selected \projects\ directory. ie. projects\Andrews.

  command                        explanation
  -----------------------------  -----------------------------------------
  webmod.bat                     Batch file that prints model self-documentation
                                 to \control\ directory then runs WEBMOD simulation
                                 as instructed in \control\webmod.control.
  webmod_gui.bat                 Batch file that prints model self-documentation 
                                 to \control\ directory then begins an interactive 
                                 session of WEBMOD simulation using the MMS Tool GUI.
  webmod.paramtool.bat           Batch file that prints model self-documentation 
                                 to \control\ directory then begins an interactive 
                                 session to review and modify WEBMOD parameters 
                                 using the Param Tool GUI.
  webmod_print.bat               Batch file that prints self-documentation files
                                 in \control\ directory

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
G. Description of .\projects\
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Three projects are included with the Distribution. Andrews, DR2, and Andrews_tutorial.
As described in WEBMOD manual.

Andrews\ simulates hydrology and geochemisty for the Andrews Creek watershed in Rocky
     Mountain National Park in Colorado. Input chemistry varies as described by biweekly
     sampling by the National Atmospheric Deposition Program.

DR2\ simulates hydrology and specific conductivity using chloride as a proxy for specific
     conductivity. Precipitation, canal irrigation, and upgradient groundwater are all
     assigned constant concentrations as described in .\input\webmod.pqi

Andrews_tutorial\ The project Andrews_tutorial is a deliberately miscalibrated version of 
     Andrews. As detailed in the User’s Manual in the section “Quick Start Guide > Andrews 
     Creek simulation and calibration”, the user is instructed to turn on geochemical 
     simulations(chem_sim=1), modifiy two hydrologic parameters, rain_adj and snow_adj, 
     in Andrews_tutorial\input\webmod.params and modify the surface to volume ratio that 
     determines the weathering rate of of oligoclase in Andrews_tutorial\input\webmod.pqi. 
     Upon completion of the 45 steps, the output files in Andrews_tutorial\output\ will be 
     identical to those in Andrew\output\.
